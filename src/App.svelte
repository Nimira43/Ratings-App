			text: "The trouble with asking for good memories of Ayrton is that I do not have any bad ones. Perhaps my very vivid meories are of his strong opinon, and most of the time he was right.",

			text: "He had this special charisma what you cannot describe. We had a really good time. And you know, when I was racing for him... I realised then how outstanding he was. But I was not that kind of jealous... I just said, 'Whatever. It's up to me to get better, to improve myself to beat him.' And I think he understood immediately that we would be playing a fair game when we're competing with each other. And so we had room for friendship. And, I mean a great great friendship over the years.",

He liked kidding around, but this side of his personality remained hidden, because most people only got to know Senna the driver, the serious, dedicated, super professional man who left everyone in awe of his talent on the track.",
